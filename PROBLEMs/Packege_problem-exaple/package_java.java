/*
*** WRITE THIS CODE IN NOTEPAD ***
 You have to create a package named name.shape
 This package should have individual classes for Rectangle, Square, Circle, Cylinder, Sphere
 Include methods like volume, surface area and getters/setters for dimensions

 BY CREATE PACKAGE can use other packages like soumyajit.shape.Rectangle, soumyajit.shape.sphere, soumyajit.shape.Cylinder, soumyajit.shape.*.
 so for Sphere ,cylinder don't have to Recreate those class ...... Instead Can Use My Own Crate class >>>
